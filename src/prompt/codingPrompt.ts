 IMPORTANT: Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object that has exactly the following keys:
  - "Make a well designed app with the given project request"
  - "framework": a string indicating the framework (or an empty string if not applicable).
  - "code": a JSON object representing the full folder structure of the project. In this structure, keys represent folder names or file names. For files, the value should be a string containing the file content. For folders, the value should be another JSON object following the same rules. For example, if the framework is React, include a "package.json", a "src" folder with necessary files (like "index.js" or "App.js"), and a "public" folder with "index.html". If a different framework is requested, output a complete and relevant file/folder structure.
  - "otherResponse": a string containing any additional responses or questions.
   Do NOT include any markdown formatting, code fences, or extra commentary.
