build a micro saas that converts technical documentation of programming technologies into json files that preserved all the info including code snippets.
the goal of these files is to add them as context into coding editors with llm so that the latest code documentation can be referenced.
the user can can feed a url to the website and then a scraper will scrape all the data from the documentation, including following links.
the app needs to be connected to google gemini api to evaluate the data, whcih links to follow and how to strucutre the json data correctly to fit to a standardized model
that is ideal for llm's to understand so that it is the most useful to feed ai code editors.

the doc will then be stored.
